<h3> Phylosophy </h3>

_“In modern society, certain subjects have been heavily controlled by a little group of people who decide what should and should not be popular. Eduality allows people to promote themselves and get the recognition that they deserve, to the extent of even getting the chance of working with brands we have agreements with.”_
